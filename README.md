# Wealthfront Inc Case Study

## Overwiew and Origin
Wealthfront Inc
The company was founded in 2008 and launched in 2011
By Co founders Andy Rachleff and Dan Carrooll 
The idea for Welathfront came about when Andy realized he simply wanted more people to have the same investing advantages as other high net worth indviduals. Andy sought out to find someone who wanted the same and found Dan who was already working on a prototype software of the idea. Together Andy and Dan realized that they not only shared a mission — to help democratize access to sophisticated financial advice — they agreed that software could unlock great investing for everyone. So they gathered some of the best technical minds they knew, and went to work.
