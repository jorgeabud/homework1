# Wealthfront Inc Case Study

## Overwiew and Origin
Wealthfront Corp 
It is a Holding Company with three subsidiaries:
* Wealthfront Brokerage Corp.
* Wealthfront Strategies LLC
* Wealthfront Advisers LLC

The company was founded in 2008 and launched in 2011.
By Co founders Andy Rachleff and Dan Carrooll. 

The idea for Welathfront came about when Andy realized he simply wanted more people to have the same investing advantages as other high net worth indviduals. Andy sought out to find someone who wanted the same and found Dan who was already working on a prototype software of the idea. Together Andy and Dan realized that they not only shared a mission — to help democratize access to sophisticated financial advice — they agreed that software could unlock great investing for everyone. So they gathered some of the best technical minds they knew, and went to work.

Wealthfront is funded through multiple investors. It has received funding from Benchmark Capital, DAG Ventures, Index Ventures, The Social+ Capital Partnership, along with some funding from individual investors. The initial funding round brought the firm to $65.5 million. Right now they have an estimated funing of $210 million.

## Business Activities
Wealthfront is a next-gen banking service that helps in managing the money for both the short term and long term by providing a cash account with one of the highest APYs on the market, best in class automated investment management and free financial advice, anytime.

The intended customer for the company is anyone that wants to invest their money for retirment, college fund, or just wants to diversify their portofolio. But do not have the time to manage their portfolio daily lack the expertise, or just want to simplify the process without having to pay high management fees. However, one disadvantage that Wealthfront when compared to other companies that provide the same services is that they do not offer fractional shares of ETSs, which prevents the company from investing you entire deposit. It also maintains a cash balance equal to the fees you’re projected to owe over the next year, so accounts are likely to experience a small level of cash drag.

Machine Learning Wealthfront offers daily tax-loss harvesting on all taxable accounts. New clients who transfer in assets may benefit from its Tax-Minimized Brokerage Account Transfer service. That service incorporates existing investments into the Wealthfront portfolio where possible and holds transferred securities that can’t be incorporated until capital gains become long-term. Wealthfront will benefit anyone who wants frequent tax-loss harvesting. Wealthfront’s daily tax-loss harvesting offering is much more frequent than other robos on the market.

Wealthfront launched an exciting new service called Autopilot that automates a client's savings plan so they no longer need to manually monitor accounts and move money around. This is a huge milestone toward Wealthfront's ultimate goal of delivering a nextgen banking service that fully automates their clients' finances, or what they refer to as Self-Driving Money.

Wealthfront competitors include companies like Acorns, Betterment, Vanguard, and Financial Engines

## Results
Automated accounts are generally cheaper because they use computer algorithms rather than human money managers.Wealthfront investment has been increasingly popular among young investors. Wealthfront reported that account signups are about 68% higher since stocks declined in early march as people look to grow their savings before retirement. Wealthfront said its average customer age is 32.

One of the most important metrics when it comes to Wealth Management is Assets under Management, and the return on their investments. The more AUM a company has the more investors are going to trust that it is a respectable insitution. Coupled, with great returns and good costumer satisfaction Robo Advisors are revolutionizing the way  people invest in the markets.

Welathfront is is the second largest independent robo-advisor only trailing Betterment, with at least $10 billion in assets under management. However, Betterment has an average annual investment return of just under 8.8%. Wealthfront is at 7.62% on its taxable portfolios, and 8.52% on its tax-advantaged portfolios. This does not reflect all the facts as the data reported for Betterment only ran through July 2018.

Wealthfront has an advantage over Betterment, as Wealthfront is the only robo-advisor that offers the 529 College Savings account. A feature that attracts many people seeking to invest for a childs education. 

## Recommendations
Wealthfront offers Socially Responsible Investing but only through their Smart Beta option requires minimum investment of $500,000. The world is changing, and a strategy which seeks to consider both financial return and social/environmental good to bring about social change are regarded as positive by proponents. Betterment offers this service for everyone not only to people with large portfolios.
They could also reduce fees for people with higher portfolios.

The world i rapidly changing, and before people were only interested about making money. Now the way that their money is made is a concern for investors especially for millenials. Therefore, in order to not loose market share and remain competitive for years to come, Wealthfront has to consider the pros and cons of implementing this feature to be available for everyone. 

Wealthfront has the advantage in that they are already thinking about Socially Responsible Investing, now they just have to make it available to younger people who are the most impacted by the new changing world. Young investors who make up most of Wealthfront's customers do not have $500,000 to invest,  but many would weigh in this feature when considering whit what company to open their portfolio.
