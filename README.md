# Wealthfront Inc Case Study

## Overwiew and Origin
Wealthfront Corp 
It is a Holding Company with three subsidiaries:
* Wealthfront Brokerage Corp.
* Wealthfront Strategies LLC
* Wealthfront Advisers LLC

The company was founded in 2008 and launched in 2011.
By Co founders Andy Rachleff and Dan Carrooll. 

The idea for Welathfront came about when Andy realized he simply wanted more people to have the same investing advantages as other high net worth indviduals. Andy sought out to find someone who wanted the same and found Dan who was already working on a prototype software of the idea. Together Andy and Dan realized that they not only shared a mission — to help democratize access to sophisticated financial advice — they agreed that software could unlock great investing for everyone. So they gathered some of the best technical minds they knew, and went to work.[^fn1]

Wealthfront is funded through multiple investors. It has received funding from Benchmark Capital, DAG Ventures, Index Ventures, The Social+ Capital Partnership, along with some funding from individual investors. The initial funding round brought the firm to $65.5 million. Right now they have an estimated funing of $210 million.

## Business Activities
Wealthfront is a next-gen banking service that helps in managing the money for both the short term and long term by providing a cash account with one of the highest APYs on the market, best in class automated investment management and free financial advice, anytime.

The intended customer for the company is anyone that wants to invest their money for retirment, college fund, or just wants to diversify their portofolio. But do not have the time to manage their portfolio daily lack the expertise, or just want to simplify the process without having to pay high management fees. However, one disadvantage that Wealthfront when compared to other companies that provide the same services is that they do not offer fractional shares of ETSs, which prevents the company from investing you entire deposit. It also maintains a cash balance equal to the fees you’re projected to owe over the next year, so accounts are likely to experience a small level of cash drag.

Machine Learning Wealthfront offers daily tax-loss harvesting on all taxable accounts. New clients who transfer in assets may benefit from its Tax-Minimized Brokerage Account Transfer service. That service incorporates existing investments into the Wealthfront portfolio where possible and holds transferred securities that can’t be incorporated until capital gains become long-term. Wealthfront will benefit anyone who wants frequent tax-loss harvesting. Wealthfront’s daily tax-loss harvesting offering is much more frequent than other robos on the market.

Wealthfront launched an exciting new service called Autopilot that automates a client's savings plan so they no longer need to manually monitor accounts and move money around. This is a huge milestone toward Wealthfront's ultimate goal of delivering a nextgen banking service that fully automates their clients' finances, or what they refer to as Self-Driving Money.
